# Coffee Machine Project

This project is a simple command-line-based coffee machine simulation. Users can order various coffee drinks, and the program will check the inventory, process payment, and prepare the selected drink. It includes options for espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

## Features

- **Menu Items**: The coffee machine offers the following menu items:
  - Espresso: Ingredients - water, coffee, Price - $1.50
  - Latte: Ingredients - water, milk, coffee, Price - $2.50
  - Cappuccino: Ingredients - water, milk, coffee, Price - $3.00

- **Inventory Management**: The program keeps track of available ingredients, including water, milk, and coffee. It checks the inventory before preparing a drink and updates the inventory accordingly.

- **Payment Processing**: Users can insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) to pay for their selected drink. The program calculates change, processes the payment, and updates earnings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   """git clone <https://github.com/YourUsername/CoffeeMachine.git>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd CoffeeMachine
3. Run the program in your terminal:
   python coffee_machine.py
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select a coffee drink, insert coins, and enjoy your coffee.

## Usage

- When the program starts, it will prompt you to select a coffee drink (espresso, latte, or cappuccino).

- You can also request a "report" to see the current inventory levels and earnings.

- To exit the program, type "off" when prompted for a drink choice.
